[QUESTION]
The task goal is Clean the kitchen area. Considering the progress described in the video caption and my current observation, what action is C about to take?
[OPTION]
OPTION 0: wipe hands with cloth
OPTION 1: put dirt in bin
OPTION 2: open floor bin
OPTION 3: turn on tap on kitchen sink
"OUPUT":
[DESCRIPTION]: Based on the observation, C is holding dirt, the bin is closed, the cloth is on the table, and the tap is not observed.
[OPTION REASONING]:
0. wipe hands with cloth: To do this, C must first set down the dirt and then pick up the cloth.
1. put dirt in bin:  To do this, C must first open the bin, as it is currently closed.
2. open floor bin: By doing this, C can subsequently "put dirt in bin", following the logical sequence of actions.
3. turn on tap on kitchen sink: To do this, C would need to move closer to the tap, as it is not observed in the current view.
[SUMMARY]: Based on the reasoning, opening the floor bin is the most direct action C is about to take.
